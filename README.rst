Overview
========

sqlalchemy\_auth provides authorization mechanisms for SQLAlchemy DB
access.

It is easy to use, and easy to bypass when needed.

1. You set a ``badge`` on a session, which is passed to various
   handlers.
2. All mapped classes can add implicit filters on queries and implicit
   data on inserts.
3. All mapped classes can selectively block attribute access.

Your ``badge`` is shared between all queries and mapped class instances
within a session.

Getting Started
===============

Session
~~~~~~~

Create a session using the AuthSession and AuthQuery classes:

.. code:: python

    Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine, class_=AuthSession, query_cls=AuthQuery, badge=DENY)
    session = Session()

By default you don't need no stinking ``badge``. It is set to ``ALLOW``,
bypassing all auth mechanisms (the default is overridden above). Change
``badge`` from ``ALLOW`` to enable authorization:

.. code:: python

    session.badge=badge

Temporarily switch ``badge``:

.. code:: python

    with session.switch_badge(badge):
        ...

``badge`` can be anything (the current user, their role, etc.), and will
be passed in to ``add_auth_filters`` and ``add_auth_insert_data``
(unless it's ``ALLOW`` or ``DENY``).

Filters
~~~~~~~

To add filters, define ``add_auth_filters``:

.. code:: python

    class Data(Base):
        __tablename__ = "data"

        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
        owner = Column(Integer)
        data = Column(String)

        @classmethod
        def add_auth_filters(cls, query, badge):
            return query.filter_by(owner=badge.user_id)

Inserts
~~~~~~~

To add data on insert, define ``add_auth_insert_data``:

.. code:: python

    class Data(Base):
        __tablename__ = "data"

        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
        owner = Column(Integer)
        data = Column(String)

        def add_auth_insert_data(self, badge):
            self.owner = badge.user_id

Default Filters and Inserts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your ``Base`` inherits from ``AuthBase``, you will inherit no-op
``add_auth_filters`` and ``add_auth_insert_data`` methods.

Attribute Blocking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To block attributes, inherit from the ``BlockBase`` class (you can also
use mixins instead of ``declarative_base(cls=BlockBase)``):

.. code:: python

    Base = declarative_base(cls=BlockBase)

    class AttributeCheck(Base):
        __tablename__ = "attributecheck"

        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
        owner = Column(String)
        data = Column(String)
        secret = Column(String)

        def _blocked_read_attributes(self, badge):
            if self.owner == badge.user_id:
                return []
            return ["secret"]

        def _blocked_write_attributes(self, badge):
            blocked = ["id", "owner"]
            if self.owner != badge.user_id:
                blocked.append("data")
            return blocked

These methods are only called if badge != ``ALLOW`` and you are within a
transaction. By default, ``_blocked_write_attributes`` calls
``_blocked_read_attributes``.

Four convenience methods are defined:

``readable_attrs()``, ``read_blocked_attrs()``, ``writable_attrs()`` and
``write_blocked_attrs()``

Here are some examples of attribute blocking:

.. code:: python

    a = session.query(AttributeCheck).one()

    if "secret" in a.readable_attrs():
        display_secret(a)

    try:
        a.data = "value"
    except AuthException:
        raise

Attribute blocking is only effective for instances of the mapped class.

Gotchas
=======

One Badge per Session/Query/Objects Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only one badge exists between a session, its queries and returned
objects. For example:

.. code:: python

    session.badge = ALLOW
    query = session.query(Data)
    unfiltered = query.all()

    session.badge = badge
    filtered = query.all()

In this example, ``unfiltered`` will contain all Data objects, but the
same query later would return a ``filtered`` subset.

Scoped Session Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To support ``scoped_session.query`` style syntax with ``badge`` and
``switch_badge``, you must run ``instrument_scoped_session`` on the
value returned by ``sqlalchemy.orm.scoped_session()``.

If you do not, setting ``badge`` will have no effect and calling
``switch_badge`` will raise
``AttributeError: 'scoped_session' object has no attribute 'switch_badge'``.

Attribute Blocking Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Attribute blocking relies on the object being an instance of the class
with blocks. In the following example, ``add_auth_filters`` is applied,
but blocks are not:

.. code:: python

    obj = session.query(Class.attr, Class.blocked_attr).first()
    obj.blocked_attr = "foo"

Similarly, ``update`` bypasses attribute blocks:

.. code:: python

    query = session.query(Class.blocked).update({Class.blocked: "unchecked write"})
